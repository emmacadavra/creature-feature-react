## **Testing Overview**

Below I have documented the testing undertaken throughout development for this respository's code.

For information on back-end testing, please follow the link to this project's [**_back end respository's TESTING.md document_**](https://github.com/emmacadavra/creature-feature-drf-api/blob/main/TESTING.md).

## **Testing Throughout Development**

### **Manual Testing**

A lot of testing work was undertaken throughout this project in both the back and front-end counterparts to ensure that things ran smoothly and without errors, though I found that this front-end app required the most testing as I encountered significantly more bugs with my React code than with the back-end Python/Django code. I believe this is in part because it is newer to me but also because back-end code is much more linear whereas in the UI there is a lot more complexity around managing the live state of the UI and user interactions.

I did enlist the help of several friends to try and use all of the functionality within the site to not only validate it but to also 'break it' to try to find bugs. That included:

- Interacting with elements in ways that I didn't necessarily expect.
- Some attempting to inject HTML/Javascript snippets into form posts.
- Entering other unusual information into forms, such as just white spaces.
- More tech-savvy friends testing security by trying to e.g. create posts masquerading as another users by sending requests directly to the backend (outside of the UI).

### **Testing and Quality Control Tools**

I used a variety of methods to test my code as I went along, in particular making frequent use of console logs (_a LOT of console logs_) to track the journey of data being passed between functions or components, and to identify where the code stops working if I encountered errors, bugs, or generally undesired results.

I am aware of the debug tools available in VSCode that could allow me to add 'breakpoints' and step through code but I unfortunately did not have time to properly learn and utilise this to comfortable degree.

I did leverage the following tools to help with my code quality during this project:

- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) to ensure my code style is consistent across all of my files.
- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) to help catch code problems early.
- [**Todo Tree**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) to keep track of in-code 'todo's' to come back to and address.

### **Noteworthy Bugs During Development**

As mentioned above, I found that I came across significantly more bugs in my front-end code than I did in my back-end code, and this is largely due to React being new to me. I also made the choice to use the most recent versions of Create React App, as well as the newest versions of React Bootstrap and React Router Dom, whereas most of my learning material used previous versions of all three - this meant that I spent a lot of time fixing bugs that I had caused by unknowingly using outdated and/or incompatible code. Below are a few of the most noteworthy bugs I encountered - some are simple, but some much more complex from my view that often took much, much longer to resolve than anticipated!

- Certain characters in my code were not escaping properly (namely apostrophes) which caused errors in my code and in some cases prevented the site from running at all. This was fixed by replacing the offending apostrophes with `&apos;`.
- No error handling was appearing when attempting to upload an image that’s too big. This was fixed by adding a react `useState` to capture and show errors on the form.
- The 'ProfileDataContext' component caused an infinite loop of requesting the list of profiles over and over again. This was because the profile ID being pulled from the URL was a string, but the comparison used to stop those requests expected a number. Converting the string value to a number using `Number(profileId)` fixed this issue.
- In the MoreDropdown component, I was getting the eslint error "Component definition is missing display name" when trying to use React Bootstrap’s custom dropdown code. To fix this, I added `ThreeDotsMeatballs.displayName = "ThreeDotsMeatballs"` below the code.
- When creating the CreateEditPost component, at first the form was not rendering, and throwing the error “Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined”. I realised this was due to me following the course content, which used an earlier version of React Bootstrap. I replaced “Form.File” with “Form.Control” with type= “file”, which fixed the issue.
- In the PostFilters component, `useNavigate` was not working correctly, as users do not navigate to different pages on the homepage. The initial solution was to keep the query in the URL in sync with the text field by using useSearchParams. However, this caused the search bar to either not allow being typed into (if `value={query}`), or it was keeping the searched keywords in the search bar after clicking Home (if `defaultValue={query}`). Additionally, by making it a controlled form, debounce was no longer working. The solution I used for this is to manually keep the text field in sync by getting the element from the DOM directly, and updating it that way.
- Unfortunately extremely late in development, I realised I had made a huge oversight in regards to editing comments, as I had forgotton to include an 'isOwner' rule to the MoreDropdown component displayed in the Comment component. This meant that users were given the option to edit other users' comments, and although upon trying to do so the site would throw an error as this is not allowed through the API, it still contributes to bad user experience. This issue was fixed with a simple 'isOwner' conditional statement that was sadly overlooked in initial development.

## Post Development Testing

### **Code Validation**

CODE VALIDATION

#### **Lighthouse Scores**

Below are the Lighthouse testing results for the two main pages - he Homepage and Profile page.

The performance score in particular is much lower than I would like, as given the nature of the site, it is at the whim of the images uploaded by other uses. I would like to add more work around image optimisation if I had more time to improve on that. Additionally, the best practice score is not ideal, but this is due to recent changes in the way Lighthouse operates in regards to third-party cookies. The way that the back-end API is set up with Django AllAuth and Django Rest Auth means that cookies are always created, which brought the score down.

##### **Homepage scores:**

##### **Profile page scores:**

### **Unresolved Bugs**

- The back end would return a '500 Server Error' when uploading a certain image when creating a post. It appears it was due to a comma being used in the file name, but I can't be entirely certain of this due to the vague error that came back from the database. Even after implementing error handling, that specific file creates the same vague error so I am not able to confidently say what the source of the bug is.
- When a logged in user clicks the three dots menu icon (to edit/delete content), which uses React Bootstrap's Dropdown component, the user has to click on it three times in order for it to activate (but only the first time they do so in each instance). I and my mentor are both still unclear as to what causes this to happen.
- Although not technically a bug as such, some of the app's functionality/UI on mobile (_especially_ iPhones) is less ideal than it is on desktop/larger screens. Although I always try to take a mobile-first approach, I developed this project on a large desktop screen, predominantly using the responsive mode in Google Chrome's Dev Tools to test how responsive the site is across different device sizes and breakpoints, which I recognise isn't always a perfect representation of how a site responds on a variety of devices. In future I would like to spend some time learning about why certain components in this app struggle more with responsive design than others, to improve my understanding as to how I can prevent these sorts of inconsistencies going forward.

## **User Story Testing**

My User Stories can be found by following this link to [**_this repository’s project board_**](https://github.com/users/emmacadavra/projects/5). Further information on these User Stories can be found in the separate [**_AGILE.md_**](AGILE.md) document found in this repository. Below, I have detailed how I tested the User Stories through the front-end. Testing for these User Stories relating to the back-end can be found in the [**_back-end repository's TESTING.md document_**](https://github.com/emmacadavra/creature-feature-drf-api/blob/main/TESTING.md).

| When a user scrolls to the 'next' page, but more posts have been created in the time between them loading the page and scrolling to the 'bottom' (causing the posts that were on page 1 to now show on page 2, for example), the API removes any "duplicate" posts so the user experience is not interrupted |    &check;    |

| Logged out users can only ever see the default sticker styling with the totals beneath, and trying to react to a post brings up an overlay explaining that you must be logged into react to posts                                     |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user reacts to a post, the reaction they select updates to a more contrasted/saturated image and the count beneath it increases by 1                                                                                 |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user reacts to a post, the two reactions they did not select update to a slightly pink greyscale, indicating clearly to the user that only one reaction can be chosen per post                                       |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user creates a post, the reactions beneath the post will always show as the default styling to them, and if they try to react to their own post, an overlay will pop up explaining that they are not able to do this |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user reacts to a post, this post will be added to the top of their 'My Faves' feed                                                                                                                                   |    &check;    |
| Styled indicators of user reactions are only displayed to the user who has reacted to the post - other users are not able to see the reaction styling that is applied by other users' reactions                                       |    &check;    |

| **As a logged in user, I can click/tap again on a reaction to undo it, with clear visual feedback that I have done so, so that I can choose a different reaction if I change my mind**                                                                                                                                                                       | **Complete?** |

| When a logged in user reacts to a post, and then clicks again on the same reaction, this 'deletes' the reaction, descreasing the number below it by 1 and restoring the styling of the stickers to their default state                                                                                                                                       |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user 'deletes' their reaction to a post, that post will no longer appear in their 'My Faves' feed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user reacts to a post, and then clicks a different reaction on the same post, their first choice is undone (the total below it decreasing again by 1), and their new choice becomes highlighted, increasing that reaction's total by 1 and greying out the other two - this can be done ad infinitum if the user so wishes                  |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user changes their reaction to a post, that post will display at the top of their 'My Faves' feed, but only once, and with the most recent reaction they have chosen (unless they are already viewing their 'My Faves' feed, in which case the post will remain in place until the user navigates away from that feed and comes back later) |    &check;    |

### **User Stories: Comments**

| **As a logged in user, I can click to expand and read the comments under posts so that I can read what other users think about the posts**                                                                                                                                               | **Complete?** |

| Each post displays a sticker in the bottom-right corner, next to some text that tells the user how many comments that post has                                                                                                                                                           |    &check;    |
| Users can click the sticker to expand the post's comments below the post, and click it again to collapse them - this removes the need to navigate to a separate post page just to read comments, causing the user to lose the place they had scrolled to                                 |    &check;    |
| Logged out users can only see the comments left on posts and are never shown the option to leave a comment                                                                                                                                                                               |    &check;    |
| After clicking the button to toggle displaying the comments, logged in users will see a text box above the comments that prompts them to leave a comment if they want to                                                                                                                 |    &check;    |
| If a logged in user clicks the button to toggle displaying the comments on a post that has no comments, a message is displayed to confirm that there are no comments, and invites them to be the first                                                                                   |    &check;    |
| If a logged out user clicks the button to toggle displaying the comments on a post that has no comments, a message is displayed to confirm that there are no comments to display, but does not invite them to be the first as they are not logged in and therefore cannot leave comments |    &check;    |

| **As a logged in user I can add comments to a post so that I can share my thoughts about the post**                                                                                                                                           | **Complete?** |

| When a logged in user posts a comment, the comment section of the post is re-rendered and their comment is displayed at the top (comments are displayed newest first, as with posts)                                                          |    &check;    |
| When a logged in user comments on a post, the text displaying how many comments the post has increases by 1 as additional confirmation that the comment has been posted, and to let other users know that there are more comments on the post |    &check;    |
| Check error handling is working correctly by trying to leave a comment that is blank - site will not allow it                                                                                                                                 |    &check;    |
