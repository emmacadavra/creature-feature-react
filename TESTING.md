## **Testing Overview**

Below I have documented the testing undertaken throughout development for this respository's code.

For information on back-end testing, please follow the link to this project's [**_back end respository's TESTING.md document_**](https://github.com/emmacadavra/creature-feature-drf-api/blob/main/TESTING.md).

## **Testing Throughout Development**

### **Manual Testing**

A lot of testing work was undertaken throughout this project in both the back- and front-end counterparts to ensure that things ran smoothly and without errors, though I found that this front-end app required the most testing as I encountered significantly more bugs with my React code than with the back-end Python/Django code. This is likely due to React being new to me when starting this project.

I used a variety of methods to test my code as I went along, in particular making frequent use of console logs (_a LOT of console logs_) to track the journey of data being passed between functions or components, and to identify where the code stops working if I encountered errors, bugs, or generally undesired results.

During developing, I almost always had the site running on my local server by using the `npm start` command, which helped me track updates to the site in real time.

In addition, I used two very important VSCode plugins - [**_ESLint_**](https://eslint.org/), and [**_Todo Tree_**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree).
