# Creature Feature

## **Project Overview**

Creature Feature is a quirky and fun interactive photo-sharing app dedicated to our often smaller - but by no means lesser - animal companions. Although it shares its name with the famous horror/sci-fi genre of films known as 'Creature Features', the creatures featured on this platform are anything but spooky… Unless they want to be, of course! That said, despite the cutesy aesthetic this app employs, the spirit of the genre is subtly kept alive through the unusual names of the [**_post categories_**](#categories) users must pick from to let the world know what type of creature it is they’re featuring! The thematic combining of the _’creepy & kooky’_ with the charming & adorable provides a truly distinctive, engaging platform for users to _sink their claws into_.

The primary intention of this app is to provide a smooth, user-friendly platform on which registered users can create posts containing pictures of their beloved pets, and engage with posts created by other users. They can view and follow the [**_profiles_**](#profile-page) of other users whose posts they enjoy, control what they see by utilising a variety of [**_post filters_**](#post-filters), and - most importantly - interact with and comment on the posts they can see. What makes this app stand out against others of its kind are the three [**_adorable post reactions_**](#reactions) that replace ‘likes’ or the more traditional kinds of post reactions found on other social media platforms.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
